# Contact Center Workforce KPI Dashboard

I’ve just completed my second real-world Excel project — a **Contact Center Workforce Performance Dashboard** built entirely from scratch.

This project simulates the role of a **Workforce or Data Analyst** tracking key performance metrics (KPIs) in a customer service environment.

### Project Overview
The dashboard provides insights into weekly team and agent performance using data-driven visualizations and key metrics such as:
- **Adherence (%)**
- **Absence Rate (%)**
- **Average Handle Time (AHT in seconds)**
- **Productivity (calls/hour)**

### Key Features
- Data cleaning and standardization  
- Dynamic **Pivot Tables** and calculated metrics  
- **Conditional formatting** for performance visualization (color-coded indicators)  
- Interactive **slicers** for team-level filtering  
- Fully designed **Excel dashboard** with agent-level and team-level KPIs

### Objectives
- Simulate real-world Workforce Analysis reporting in a call center  
- Create a visual, interactive dashboard for management insights  
- Strengthen Excel data analysis and visualization skills

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, Slicers)
- Data Modeling techniques for KPI analysis

### Next Steps
This project is part of my ongoing **Data Analysis learning journey**.  
Next, I’ll continue building projects with **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python** to expand my analytical and automation skills.
